# AMR

The software you can find in this directory was used to simulate read liybraries and perform metagenomic analysis on them in order to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To explain the functioning of the set of tools that was used is usefull to devide the process in three:

- Read library simulation
- Resistome evaluation
- Machine learning

## Read library generation

The read library generation is the procedure that we implemented in order to obtain simulated read libraries starting from genome sequences (.fasta files)
